Olin Alumni Council Charter


Purpose
=======

The Olin Alumni Council (OAC) serves as the organizing body for Olinâ€™s Alumni Association, which is open to all students who have been enrolled in a full-time degree program at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. The OAC fosters a spirit of association and fellowship among members and helps advance the mission of the College through its activities.


Membership
==========

The OAC is composed of a representative from each graduating class in addition to an Executive Board. Election, resignation and impeachment procedures are discussed in the OAC By-Laws.


Meetings
========

The OAC will meet on campus once each fall in conjunction with the Alumni Weekend or a similar event, and will conduct one meeting via teleconference in the spring. It is expected that OAC members will attend the on-campus meeting. Between meetings, telephone calls or e-mail communications will be used to conduct business outside of the spring and fall meetings mentioned above. Travel expenses will be the responsibility of the members.


Leadership
==========

Leadership will be provided by a five member Executive Board. The Board will include the OAC President, President-elect, Past-President, Treasurer and Secretary. The responsibilities of these offices and the Board as a whole are detailed in the OAC By-Laws.


Report to the President
=======================

At least once each year the President of the OAC shall meet with the President of the College to report on the status of the Alumni Association and discuss plans for the coming year. The purpose of this report is to foster formal communication between the President of the College and the OAC, and to enhance the process of innovation and continuous improvement throughout the College.
